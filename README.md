# Inspire Tree Angular2 Demo

This is an extremely basic demo implementation of a native Angular2 renderer.

This repo originally was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.15.

## Local Use

Ensure angular-cli is installed: `npm i -g angular-cli`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
